International Meme Fund is an Ethereum-native credit system designed to extend lending to assets and communities typically ignored by traditional DeFi. It enables borrowing and lending against volatile collateral in isolated markets, treating credit as infrastructure rather than speculation.

I led the project across product, technical framing, and narrative. The challenge was to combine serious financial primitives with clear, memetic communication, making a complex credit machine understandable, usable, and culturally distinct.
