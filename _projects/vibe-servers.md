Vibe Servers explores a simple idea for the agentic era: fat servers, thin clients. Instead of living inside apps all day, users delegate work to private machines that run agents, automations, and workflows on their behalf, while interacting through lightweight interfaces.

My work here focuses on concept, system design, and framing. The goal is to translate how people want to live and work into infrastructure that feels obvious, trustworthy, and human-scale, with ownership, privacy, and reliability as first principles.
