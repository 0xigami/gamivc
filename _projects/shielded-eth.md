Shielded ETH is a cultural and technical stance that treats privacy as a prerequisite for sound money. The core belief is that surveillance and sovereignty are incompatible, and that financial systems without privacy inevitably become tools of control.

This project is about articulation and propagation. The work centers on framing privacy as a shared value, making the risks of transparent money legible, and providing a simple rallying point for people who believe Ethereum should support private, permissionless economic activity.
