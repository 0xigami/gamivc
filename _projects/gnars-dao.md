Gnars DAO is a community-owned skateboarding collective built on Ethereum. It uses onchain auctions to fund skate culture directly, routing proceeds into a shared treasury that the community governs. The result is a headless brand that supports skaters, filmmakers, events, and grassroots projects without a central authority or corporate filter.

I helped originate and shape Gnars across mechanism design, governance, and narrative. The work sits at the intersection of crypto primitives and skate culture, ensuring the system remains legible, permissionless, and aligned with the values of the scene it exists to serve.
